When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One scenario where a remote repository would be beneficial is when using multiple machines
while working on the same repository. I would use the remote repository as the main one
ensuring that any changes I made regardless of the machine would be immediately reflected on
the remote repository.
