When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One scenario where a remote repository would be beneficial is when using multiple machines
while working on the same repository. I would use the remote repository as the main one
ensuring that any changes I made regardless of the machine would be immediately reflected on
the remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By having manual control over when Git pulls from a remote repository a user can
effectively manipulate the state of a local repository by deciding whether or not
to incorporate the latest remote commits into the local repository.
